# Introduction

In this report we will be discussing our design process and choices. We will start with the design of building components. 
Second segment focuses on generating the building mass.
After this we will go over how the mass was turned into an actual building.
This will be continued by the explanation of designing the surrounding area and lastly how the building has been textured and visualized.
