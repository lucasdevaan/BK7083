# Design of Building Components

## Types of Homes

Our building consists of three types of different homes;
there are apartments for students, starting families and elderly people.
The properties of each type of home will be explained in the following part.

### Student Home

|                                            |     |
|--------------------------------------------|-----|
| Has a shared space                         | Yes |
| Has shared utilities? (kitchen, bathrooms) | Yes |
| No. of residents                           | 8   |
| No. of units in building                   | 50  |
| Size (sqm)                                 | 153 |

The student home is 153 m2 in size. Our voxel size is 3 x 3 x 3 m.
This means that each student home will have a size of **17 voxels**.
This unconventional number of voxels and the large number of residents has resulted in the following shape.
The student homes will have eight bedrooms, one large kitchen, two toilets, two showers and one large communal living space.
The plan of the student homes is designed in a way that every bedroom and living space has access to sunlight.


### Starter Home

|                                            |     |
|--------------------------------------------|-----|
| Has a shared space                         | No  |
| Has shared utilities? (kitchen, bathrooms) | No  |
| No. of residents                           | 2-4 |
| No. of units in building                   | 200 |
| Size (sqm)                                 | 72  |

The starter home has a size of 72 m2. This means that the starter home will have a size of **8 voxels**. 
There is space in this home for a starting family. The unit has a kitchen, bathroom, two bedrooms and a living space.
This unit is designed in a way that every room except for the bathroom will have access to sunlight.


### Elderly Home

|                                            |     |
|--------------------------------------------|-----|
| Has a shared space                         | No  |
| Has shared utilities? (kitchen, bathrooms) | No  |
| No. of residents                           | 1-2 |
| No. of units in building                   | 200 |
| Size (sqm)                                 | 54  |

The elderly homes will have two available options.
There will be rooms where the residents will receive daily care and there will be rooms for more independent elderly. 
The elderly homes will have a square footage of 54 m2. This means that the elderly homes will have a size of **6 voxels**.
The rooms will have one big bedroom, a kitchen, bathroom and s living room. 


## Gallery’s

The gallery’s will be placed at the middle of the large volume that is the building. 
The initial plan was creating corridors with differentiating sizes between the two sides of units placed in the building. 
The result of this was a building with a corridor of 9 meters wide, placed in the middle of the building. 
These corridors would have no access to sunlight. 
Without the gallery it would only be possible to place windows on one of the sides of the units. 
By creating the gallery’s, it is made possible that windows can be placed on two sides on the units.

The galleries consist of concrete slabs with metal bars in a bright yellow color.
The color yellow is used to emphasize on the “public” property of the galleries.
The color yellow is a theme in the Shie Towers, used in several parts of the building and surrounding area. 
This yellow theme and the system the galleries adhere to will be explained later on.


## Ground Floor

The ground floor of the Schie Towers consists out of several functions.
The ground floor has a café that doubles in function as a coworking space, an elderly care center that doubles in function as an elderly community-hub, and an art gallery.
The ground floor also has a large passage where people can access one of the four elevators and every public function available on this floor.
