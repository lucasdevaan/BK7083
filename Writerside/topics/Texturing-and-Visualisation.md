# Texturing and Visualisation

## Final Floor Plan
The different housing units are clustered in a way that the starter and elderly homes are on the lower levels and the student homes are placed at the top of the building. 
This is visible in the floorplan. The ground floor is solely meant for public purposes. 
So there is a caf√© with room for workspaces. There is also a care center, which is especially convenient for the elderly. 
The remainder space can be used as an art gallery or other small businesses.

## Materials
For the materialization of the building we were inspired by the surrounding buildings. 
The walls of the building are made from bricks. The wall on the side of the train tracks is made thicker for a noise reducing effect.
Also, the windows have the same kind of appearance as the surrounding buildings.
Each housing unit has a different brick pattern and window, which we designed ourselves. 
The plinth of the building is mainly from glass with yellow details, so it has a public appearance. 

## Renders

The building is rendered in Twinmotion.
