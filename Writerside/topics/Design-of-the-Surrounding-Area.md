# Design of the Surrounding Area

## Park and yellow route

Because the building is located in the middle of Rotterdam, adding enough greenery to the location was important.
In the middle of our building and the existing buildings, we decided to design a park. 
The park consists of a lot of grass fields with a lot of plants and trees. 
This makes it a nice place for recreational activities, but it also stimulates the biodiversity. 

A remarkable element in the area surrounding the Schieblock is the yellow route, also known as the Luchtsingel.
This route connects the city centre to the north of Rotterdam, and it goes straight through the Schieblock.
We did not want to get rid of this route, so we implemented it in our design. 
This is visible in multiple aspects of our design. First of all the park is crossed by multiple yellow pathways. 
And also the plinth of the building and the skatepark has yellow elements. 
So we gave the yellow colour a public meaning by placing it on public areas.

## Skatepark 

Because of the creative and urban atmosphere the Schieblock radiates, a skate park seemed like a perfect addition to the public outdoor space. 
It does not only function as a place for skateboarding, but also as a water storage.
The rainwater that falls in the surrounding area and on the rooftops will be drained towards the skatepark,
so the skatepark can the overflow of water can be storaged in the skatepark.

## Infrastructure

The new public area that is designed, is a no car zone. This makes it a nice and safe place for bike users and pedestrians. 
There is a bike lane just along the building, so the building is easily accessible by bike, which is ideal in a city as Rotterdam.
The bikes can be parked in the underground bike parking lot, which is accessible by two entrances that are close to the entrances of the building.
There is also an underground car park next to the building. This will be places under the existing car ramp.
